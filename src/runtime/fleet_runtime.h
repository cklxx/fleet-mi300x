// Fleet runtime: AOT task queues, hierarchical events, XCD discovery.
//
// docs/design.md §4 and §8. Task code sees only three operations —
// fetch_task, signal_event, wait_event — so the tasks stay runtime-agnostic
// and can later be moved onto the upstream ROCm/fleet-chiplet-megakernel
// without being rewritten.
//
// The protocol, in one paragraph: descriptors are built on the host, never
// mutated, and pre-assigned to per-XCD worker queues (ahead-of-time launch, so
// a worker waits on its own next event rather than being dispatched by a
// scheduler after the fact — one synchronisation hop instead of two). Each XCD
// dedicates one CU to a scheduler whose only job is to mirror global event
// counters into that XCD's flag array, so 37 workers poll a local array
// instead of 296 workers polling the global counters.
//
// Memory model. MI300X L2 is per XCD and not coherent across XCDs for
// ordinary device memory, so every cross-workgroup handshake here is written
// against the LLVM AMDGPU memory model for gfx942 rather than against cache
// folklore: producers release with an agent-scope fence (buffer_wbl2), the
// counter is an agent-scope atomic, consumers acquire with an agent-scope
// fence (buffer_inv), and polling uses agent-scope atomic loads so a stale
// L1/L2 line can never satisfy the wait. XCD-local events acquire with an
// L1-only invalidate (the payload is in the producer's own L2). With
// uncached_acts every cross-XCD activation is in MTYPE-UC memory, which no
// L2 caches, so global events drop both the writeback and the invalidate;
// the KV cache (cached, written once per layer per token, read by every XCD
// from the next token on) is the one payload that still needs them: its
// writer flushes explicitly and the token boundary keeps the acquire.
